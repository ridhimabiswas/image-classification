# image-classification

In this project, two machine learning algorithms, naive bayes and perceptron, are compared with a key interest in efficiency on two different sets of images (face and digit). 

All the coding files are included in order for the program to run. In addition, a report is also attached which includes detailed analysis of the performance.
